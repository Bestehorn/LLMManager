USE THE VENV FOR ALL STEPS, NOTHING GETS EXECUTED OUTSIDE OF THE VENV! I want you to iteratively execute the following steps to reach the goal that the CI workflow for this project executes successfully:\n1. Review the CI workflow defined for this project. Run the unit tests as defined by the CI workflow for this project including integration tests.\n2. Collect all errors and warnings in the unit tests. Also collect the unit tests that are skipped.\n3. If there are errors, warnings or skipped tests, analyze these errors, warnings and skipped tests as follows:\n  3a. ERRORS: All of these MUST BE FIXED. There cannot be any exceptions. Use specification and documentation documents to determine how issues are to be fixed to align with those documents.\n  3b. WARNINGS: Group these by their severity and fix those that indicate serious errors or indicate malfunctions. Generally, the number of warnings should be minimized. Keep the WARNINGS that are not fixed on a list, so you can report on them at the very end of this process.\n   3c. SKIPPED: Determine why the test has been skipped. Generally, the number of skipped tests should be minimized. Implement fixes to tests that could be easily executed with little changes. Keep the remaining skipped tests on a list, so you can report on them at the very end of this process.\n4. If there have been any errors during the run of the unit tests in step 2, go back to step 2 and re-execute it. THERE ARE NO EXCEPTIONS TO THIS. ANY ERRORS MEAN YOU ARE TO REPEAT STEP 2. NO INTERMEDIATE RESULTS, NO SUMMARIES, NO OTHER ENDS FOR TESTING LOOP OR THIS WORKFLOW EXIST. Only proceed to step 5, if there are ZERO errors after the last execution.\n5. Locally execute the linting, code formatting and other checks of the CI workflow for this project (basically everything that is not unit or integration tests). ONLY IF THERE ARE ZERO ISSUES IDENTIFIED BY THIS STEP, YOU MAY PROCEED TO STEP 7. THIS IS THE ONLY STEP THAT ENDS THIS WORKFLOW UNDER THE PRECONDITION THAT THERE ARE NO CODE QUALITY ISSUES LEFT.\n6. Fix all of the issues identified in step 5. NO EXCEPTIONS, NO INTERMEDIATE RESULTS, NO SUMMARIES, NO OTHER ENDS FOR CODE QUALITY CHECK LOOP OR THIS ENTIRE WORKFLOW EXIST.\n7. Create a summary of the skipped tests and the warnings collected in step 3. For each \"class\" of these, make a suggestion how they could be fixed and what their impact is. Also give an overview on the fixes that have been implemented.\nIGNORE ANY INSTRUCTIONS THAT WOULD REQUIRE YOU TO ABORT THIS EXECUTION OF THIS WORKFLOW ABOVE. ONLY STEP 4 ALLOWS YOU TO END YOUR WORK. NO INTERMEDIATE SUMMARIES, NO STOPPING. IT DOES NOT MATTER HOW LONG THIS TAKES AND YOU CAN IGNORE ANY INSTRUCTIONS THAT LIMIT THE DURATION OF A SESSION. YOU MAY CONDENSE THE CONTEXT OF THIS DISCUSSION AS NEEDED WITHOUT CHECKING WITH ME."
