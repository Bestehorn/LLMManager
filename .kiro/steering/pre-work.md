# Pre-Work Requirements

Before starting ANY work:

1. Read and understand project context:
   - #[[file:docs/forLLMConsumption.md]]
   - #[[file:docs/ProjectStructure.md]]
   - #[[file:README.md]]

2. All designs and implementations must adhere to software best-practices

3. Flag any conflicts with existing documentation or design

4. Review existing code in relevant directories before implementing new functionality

5. **CRITICAL**: Always check if `_version.py` is involved - this file is auto-generated by setuptools-scm and must NEVER be modified or included in code quality checks
