# File Organization Rules

1. **Root Directory**: Only global config files (README.md, pyproject.toml, etc.)

2. **Directory Purposes**:
   - `src/bestehorn_llmmanager/`: Production code only
   - `test/`: Pytest test code only (mirrors src/ structure)
   - `test/integration/`: Integration tests requiring AWS Bedrock access
   - `scripts/`: CLI tools and manual test scripts
   - `docs/`: Documentation for humans and coding assistants
   - `tmp/`: Temporary files (cleaned after tasks)
   - `examples/`: Usage examples and demos
   - `notebooks/`: Jupyter notebooks for exploration

3. **No Temp Files in src/**: Temporary code goes in `tmp/`

4. **Clean tmp/ After Tasks**: Deleting tmp/ must not affect the solution

5. **Auto-Generated Files**: 
   - `src/bestehorn_llmmanager/_version.py` is auto-generated by setuptools-scm
   - NEVER modify or include in code quality checks
   - Always exclude from black, isort, flake8, mypy, bandit
