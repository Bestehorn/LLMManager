# Project-Specific Rules

This file contains project-specific rules migrated from `.clinerules/` and custom rules.

## LLMManager Project Context

This is the **bestehorn-llmmanager** package - a comprehensive Python library for managing AWS Bedrock Converse API interactions.

### Core Features
- Multi-model support with automatic fallback
- Multi-region failover with intelligent routing
- Fluent MessageBuilder for multi-modal messages (text, images, documents, videos)
- Parallel processing capabilities
- Intelligent retry logic with exponential backoff
- Streaming support with automatic recovery
- Prompt caching for cost optimization

### Key Components
- `LLMManager`: Main class for single requests
- `ParallelLLMManager`: Extended class for parallel processing
- `MessageBuilder`: Fluent interface for building messages
- `BedrockResponse`: Comprehensive response object
- `UnifiedModelManager`: Manages model availability

### Critical Files
- `src/bestehorn_llmmanager/_version.py`: AUTO-GENERATED by setuptools-scm, NEVER modify
- `docs/forLLMConsumption.md`: Complete API reference for coding assistants
- `docs/ProjectStructure.md`: Project architecture and organization

### Workflow Integration
- Pre-commit checks workflow: See `.clinerules/workflows/pre-commit-checks.md`
- Test automation workflow: See `.clinerules/workflows/test_automation.md`

### AWS Bedrock Specifics
- Uses AWS Bedrock Converse API
- Supports Cross-Region Inference (CRIS) profiles
- Automatic model ID and inference profile detection
- Parses AWS documentation for model availability

## Migrated from .clinerules/venv-only.md

**Virtual Environment Rules** (CRITICAL):
- ALWAYS activate the virtual environment before running any Python or pip commands
- Virtual environment location: `venv/`
- Activation command (Windows cmd): `venv\Scripts\activate`
- Activation command (PowerShell): `venv\Scripts\Activate.ps1`
- For any pip or python commands, prepend with venv activation using `&` syntax
- Example: `venv\Scripts\activate & pip install package-name`
